\page alignment Ontological Alignment

*Ontological alignment* is
the problem of aligning two or more ontologies,
or parts of ontologies, in order to enable interoperability between them.

Within KnowRob, the goal is to align external ontologies with the KnowRob ontology,
so that data from external sources can be integrated with the Knowrob knowledge base.
This is a crucial step in enabling KnowRob to reason over data from the web, and to integrate data from different sources.
